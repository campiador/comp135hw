Machine Learning Assignment 3
k-means clustering

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:

To run your neural network:
   python hw4.py w d trainfile data_file

To run the assignment ones:
   python hw4.py

NOTE:
Check INPUT_FILES_PATH variable in hw4.py and change if necessary
By default I keep input files in ./input/hw4/ directory.


WHAT WORKS CORRECTLY:
This code works correctly on the example from page 4 of class slides
It calculates following variables correctly: x(output), s, delta, delta_prime, and weights
I expect it to produce correct results for your test neural network

WHAT WORKS INCORRECTLY:
Even though the first iteration results are correct, there is a bug that
cause the program to diverge. I have investigated and suspect it could be due to me forgetting to update variable
usages after updating their definitions in Neuron and Neural Network classes.

OUTPUT:
The resulting charts will be png files in ./output/hw4/ directory.
